    <p>
      Udon are long, thick wheat noodles traditional to Japan and other Asian
      countries. The shape and size of dried udon noodles are similar to
      fettuccine, though they cook up to a plumper texture. Fresh udon are
      rounder and plumper yet. In both cases, the smooth, pleasant texture of
      these noodles makes them appealing and versatile.

      According to some sources, udon noodles are believed to have originated in
      China, perhaps in a form closer to a dumpling than a noodle. Other sources
      cite Japan as their country of origin; this guide to udon dishes describes
      lots of delicious ways in which they’re served in the many noodle shops
      around the country. A third theory places udon noodles’ origin in Korea,
      where they’re called Garak-Guksu. We’ll stay out of this debate; suffice
      it to say that udon have been around for hundreds of years and are still a
      beloved food in several Asian countries.

        Remove your udon noodles from its package and add it to a pot of boiling
        water. Frozen udon noodles can be added directly to the pot of boiling
        water. Stir gently until your udon noodles are separated and pliable.
        This should take 1 - 2 minutes. They come precooked so avoid overcooking
        them as they can get too soft. 2 packets udon noodles Rinse and drain
        your noodles under cold water. If not using right away, drizzle on a
        little bit of oil to keep them from sticking.

        about 3 minutes or until well combined. Serve immediately. 2½ cups stir
