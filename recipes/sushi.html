    <h2>What you need</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A bamboo sushi mat, these are inexpensive and easy to find. Nori sheets,
        these are sheets of seaweed for making sushi and can be found in most
        supermarkets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sushi seasoning (vinegar), you can make this at home and it's fairly
        easy to do. But for a beginner's guide to making sushi, let's keep it
        simple and use store bought sushi seasoning / vinegar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rice, you can buy sushi rice but you can use medium grain rice which is
        normally cheaper and easier to find.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Bring water to a boil in a medium pot; stir in rice. Reduce heat to
        medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been
        absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Gently stir into
        cooked rice in the pot and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet.</li>
      <li>Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a
        thin layer of rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado,
        cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the center. Lift
        one end of the mat and roll it tightly over filling to make a complete
        roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>Use a wet, sharp knife to cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices.</li>
    </ol>
